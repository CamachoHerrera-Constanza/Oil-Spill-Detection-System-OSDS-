# Oil-Spill-Detection-System-OSDS-
The purpose of this project is to enable faster detection and attribution of oil spills in ocean waters, allowing marine traffic authorities to initiate response and enforcement actions with minimal delay and preventing water pollution.

## System functional capabilities

### 1. Event awareness
The system can **become aware** that a oil spill has occured.
*What does this part do?*
- The system does not wait for manual reports
- Awareness may be probalistic, not absolute
- It values more awareness than perfect certainty

### 2. Spatial localization
The system can locate where the spill is occuring
*What does this enable?*
- Jurisdiction determination (Exact coordinates + maritime navigation contexys)
- Risk prioritization

### 3. Temporal context
The system can estimate when the spill likely occured
*Why is this part so important?*
- Improves attribution
- Reduce the number of the candidate vessels
- Affects reponse urgency
- Provides estimations for future investigations (Event reconstructions, correlation with vessel movements and escalation decisions)

### 4. Attribution support
The system is able to provide identification for the vessels responsible for the spill.
*Why is this part the axis of the project?*
- The system does not accuse, it narrows candidates
- Supports investigation, not replaces it
- Reduce ambiguity 

### 5. Action Triggering
The system is able to prompt timely action by the appropiate authorities to reduce time action.
*This is the system's main purpose*
- Awareness becomes reponse
- The time action is reduced by constant detection and quick response
- Notification and prioritazion
